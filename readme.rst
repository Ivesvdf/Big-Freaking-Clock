Big Freaking Clock
==================
Big Freaking Clock is a very simple screen-filling clock. Check out the
Downloads section on github for a nightly build in the form of an executable
JAR file. 

Download and run this JAR file, use the menu to configure foreground and
background colors and double click inside the clock (or press CTRL+L) to fill
the entire screen.
